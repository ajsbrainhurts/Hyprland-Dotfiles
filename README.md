## Installation:
* Install Hyprland/hypridle/hyprlock/wofi

* Install JetBrainsMono Nerd Fonts, Iosevka and Iosevka Nerd Fonts
* Copy files from repo to .config
* Profit??

### Side note:
Most of the theming stuff is done with Hyprpanel and pywal. There's custom template files for window borders and cava. I use gruvbox for my GTK/QT theme. I'd recommend installing HyprGUI to tweak things to your liking with blur n stuff. My hyprlock is the official cattppuccin one that I had chatGPT replace the colors to gruvbox ones, so that might not be to your liking, lol. 
General warning to use at your own risk as I'm still pretty new at this.
